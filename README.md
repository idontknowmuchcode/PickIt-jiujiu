# A PickIt Fork with Humanized Mouse Movement System

# Original Plugin: https://github.com/exCore2/PickIt

## Overview

This is my first attempt at creating a humanized version for the mouse movement system of the PickIt plugin. While it's still a work in progress, it tries to make cursor movements look less robotic. I'm new to coding, so any feedback or suggestions are welcome!

### Current Features

- **Basic Movement Types**:
  - Simple straight-line movement
  - Random variations (still working on making these smooth)
  - Attempting to add some natural-looking curves

### Work in Progress

- Trying to add a basic fatigue system (might be buggy)
- Working on making movements more realistic
- Learning about different movement patterns

### Configuration

Basic settings you can change:

- Movement speed
- How random the movements are
- Debug mode to see what's happening

## Debug Mode

Shows simple information like:

- Current mouse position
- Basic movement stats
- Error messages when things go wrong

Note: This is a learning project, and I'm still figuring things out. Use at your own risk!
